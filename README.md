When a buyer buys his dream house, his price negotiation depends on various factors. This dataset has almost 79 explanatory variables that depends on how a customer will determine the house prices. We have to predict the price of 1460 houses given in the dataset. The dataset is divided into two parts where the training dataset contains the features and prices and the test dataset only haver the features but no pricing. We have to find the prices for the houses of the test dataset. We have to properly prepare the data and then feed the data to a regression algorithom or a deep neural network algorithm. In this report, The data preprocessing, training the regression algorithm and deep neural network model, predictions using the models are described step by step with source code.
